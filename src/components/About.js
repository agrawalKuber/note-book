        This note-taking app is quick and easy to use. The real competition here
        wasn't other note-taking apps, but a pen and scrap of paper. Similarly,
        the biggest reason to have a notes app instead of a notebook is that you
        can access it from anywhere on any device at any time, whether you're at
        your desk at work, chilling on your couch at home, or flying
        coast-to-coast.
